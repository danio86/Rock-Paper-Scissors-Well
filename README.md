# Snake 2001

Snake 2001 is a recreation of the Snake mobile game that was still played on button phones in the late 90's and 2000's. 
A snake is guided by the player through a playing field and has to collect as much food as possible. The player receives points for this. The more dangerous the food is, the more points the player gets.
This variant contains 3 levels. From level 1 to 2 only the speed changes. In both levels the snake dies if it hits the wall or if it bites itself. In level 3, a wall of fire appears in the middle of the playing field. The outer walls are permeable to it.
As a demonstration, the player already wins when he has reached 500 points.

    - The body also contains the "Game-Program-Field". This is in turn divided into different areas.


    - __Game Program Field__

     - The Game Field contains a background image. The background image shows an old vintage push button cell phone from the early 2000s. All other features are laid out over the background in a way that makes it look like you are operating this phone.

        - __Header__

            - The header contains the Snake 2001 logo which shows a snake. 
            - The header also includes the headline and score area.
             - The score area shows the current score, the current record score and the current level.

        - __Playing Field__

            - The actual playing field was created with javascript canvas and is the area where the snake is navigated and the food is placed.
                - The basic code of the Canvas and how to draw and place things inside a Canvas is taken from the following website.
                    - [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_drawing.asp)
                - Basic functions inside the Canvas (how the snake moves, grows) is taken from the following website.
                    - [Specific YouTube Tutorial] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niD3gx4BI9A&t=4505s)
                - Basic functions inside the Canvas (how moving and drawing functions are constantly repeat) is taken from the following website.

        - __The Control Area__

            - The control panel contains the start button and the control buttons of the snake for mobile devices (phones, tablets).Users on devices with a keyboard will be more likely to use the keyboard. The start button contains instructions on how to start the game. 
            - It serves as a user manual and as an intermediate step between the "Game Over Status" and the start of the game. This prevents the end screen ("Game Over" or "You Win") from being clicked away immediately by intuitively continuing to play (a direction key is pressed).
            - The start button changes color by mouse over and by clicking.
            - The control button change color by mouse over.
            - The Control Area idea and basic code is taken form the **Code-Institute Love-Maths-Project** but has been modified.

        - __The Footer__ 

        - The footer includes links to the relevant social media sites for the Game-Developer Company. The links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user. 
        - The footer is valuable to the user as it allows them to get Information via social media.
        - The footer idea and basic code is taken form the **Code-Institute Love-Running-Project** but has been slightly modified.

### Features Left to Implement

  - Planned features: 
    - There will be more levels in the future. The snake should get a face and there should be more animal and vegetable food. Besides that, enemies will come that the snake cannot eat but will harm it. From a later level, the snake should also get out of its box into a 2D world open to the right. In the distant future, the snake could also transition into a 3D world and get more movement options.

### Unfixed Bugs

 - No Bugs are unfixed.
 - There were a few bugs, but they were fixed within a short time. 
  - For example, the Sports category page displayed well in Firefox and not in Google Chrome. The image formatting caused free white areas to appear on the page in Google Chrome. 
  - Another difficulty was the dropdown button (Sport) in the header menu. This had to be formatted separately, just like the other menu buttons.



## Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - In menu on the left side, select pages
  - Scrool down to Branch and select main
  - push the Save button
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
